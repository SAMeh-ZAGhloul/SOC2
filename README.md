# Security Tools Comparison

This repository contains three major open-source security and observability platforms: Matano, OpenObserve, and Wazuh. Here's a detailed analysis of each:

## 1. Matano

### Contents
- Security data lake platform
- Detection-as-code framework
- Log transformation pipeline
- Integration connectors for 50+ sources
- Cloud-native security monitoring tools

### Technologies Used
- Rust (core implementation)
- Python (for detections and customizations)
- Apache Iceberg (table format)
- Vector Remap Language (VRL) for log transformations
- AWS Services (primary deployment platform)
- ECS (Elastic Common Schema) for data normalization

### On-Premises Deployment
- **Partially Possible**: While designed primarily for AWS, many components could be adapted for on-premises use
- **Challenges**: 
  - Heavily dependent on AWS services
  - Would require significant modifications for full on-premises deployment
  - Alternative solutions needed for AWS-specific services

## 2. OpenObserve (O2)

### Contents
- Observability platform for logs, metrics, and traces
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) capabilities
- Built-in dashboards and visualization
- Alerting system
- Data processing pipelines
- Query interface with SQL and PromQL support

### Technologies Used
- Rust (core platform)
- Vue.js (web interface)
- SQL and PromQL (query languages)
- Object Storage compatible systems
- Kubernetes (for HA deployments)
- OpenTelemetry (data collection and formats)

### On-Premises Deployment
- **Fully Supported**: Designed to be cloud-native but fully deployable on-premises
- **Storage Options**:
  - Local disk
  - MinIO (as S3 alternative)
  - Custom object storage
- **Deployment Methods**:
  - Single binary deployment
  - High Availability cluster mode
  - Kubernetes deployment

## 3. Wazuh

### Contents
- Endpoint security agent
- Security management server
- Threat detection and prevention
- File integrity monitoring
- Vulnerability detection
- Configuration assessment
- Incident response capabilities

### Technologies Used
- C (core agent and server)
- Python (extensions and integrations)
- RESTful API
- Elastic Stack integration (optional)
- SQLite and other databases
- Custom rule engines

### On-Premises Deployment
- **Fully Supported**: Primarily designed for on-premises deployment
- **Components**:
  - Wazuh server
  - Wazuh agents
  - Optional Elastic Stack
- **Deployment Options**:
  - All-in-one deployment
  - Distributed architecture
  - Multi-node clusters

## Summary of On-Premises Capabilities

1. **Wazuh**: ✅ Fully on-premises capable, designed with on-premises deployment in mind
2. **OpenObserve**: ✅ Fully on-premises capable, with multiple storage and deployment options
3. **Matano**: ⚠️ Limited on-premises capability, would require significant modifications

## Recommendations for On-Premises Deployment

If looking for a fully on-premises solution:

1. **Security Focus**: Choose Wazuh for security-centric deployments and endpoint protection
2. **Observability Focus**: Choose OpenObserve for general observability needs
3. **Data Lake**: Consider alternative solutions to Matano for on-premises security data lake needs, or be prepared for significant adaptation work

Remember that each tool has its strengths, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements and use cases.
