# Code of Conduct

Our values guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our open source projects are no exception. Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are core values we believe should live and breathe within our projects. Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

## Our Standards

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be welcoming.
- Be considerate.
- Be respectful.
- Be careful in the words that you choose.

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing conduct@matano.dev.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and the [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).
